#now we use the  simple operators  to perform simple addition , multiplication , division and subtraction
#in  python we simple use the print without any using terminator.
a=2+4   #this is the addition 
print(a)
b=4-3   #this is the  subtraction
print(b)
c=4/2   #this is the  division 
print(c)
d=5%2   #this is the division in which we find the remaninder 
print(d)
e=2*2   #this   is the multiplication  of two numbers
print(e)
